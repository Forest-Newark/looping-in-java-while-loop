# [Exercise] While Loop

In this exercise we will do the following:

* Clone a Git repository into your Projects folder
* Use Java's Random class
* Implement a method using a while loop
* Run tests

## Instructions

1. Start by opening a new Terminal session.

2. Change into your Projects directory using the `cd` command:

	`cd ~/Projects`

3. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/tiy-raleigh-java/looping-in-java-while-loop) using the `git clone` command:

	`git clone git@github.com:tiy-raleigh-java/looping-in-java-while-loop.git`

	This should create a new directory at `~/Projects/looping-in-java-while-loop`.

4. Open this project in IntelliJ

5. Find the `NumberGuesser` class, open it, and follow the instructions in the comments therein.

6. When you're ready to run this code, select "Run all tests (All in looping-in-java-while-loop)" in the drop down menu at the top of the screen and click the green Run button to the right.

7. If the tests pass, then you're done!
